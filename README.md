Overview
How often do you find your favourite flowers or healthy house-grown vegetables dry and dead because you are always forget to water them? How many times the idea of having your own small garden with healing herbs came to your mind? 
We suppose that our Growth Chamber for Plants can be used at any place and any conditions where plants supposed to grow. The reason for that is that this Smart Chamber will help you to automate and improve the process of growing the plants in couple of clicks!
The Smart Chamber will keep track of temperature and humidity around the plant, preserve the necessary humidity level and extend the light cycle which is crucial for fast and positive growth.
You need to choose the plant, prepare the water supply, setup couple of settings and enjoy the life while Chamber is doing its job
Schedule
A weekly plan for completing the project (list of tasks for each week). You need to divide the problem into subtasks that need to be solved in order to complete the whole project. The schedule should extend all the way to the final presentation and have the time you are planning to use on each step with it. Consider collective input rather than individual one. If a task takes 20h to complete according to your plan then this means that you as a team need to input that 20h not each individual.

Present it in table form. It has to have following columns: item, quantity, and whether you-need-this-component-from-us. This information is crucial for your projects success. The table should contain all of the components you need to complete the project. Have look at the available hardware list at the end of the project topic. We might be able to provide some hardware outside of this list but in other cases you need to provide your own hardware if you need something out of the ordinary.

I checked the repository the project has been discussed and we are planning to make next steps as soon as possible. By Sakhawat

# Overview:
We are going to solve the problem of getting fresh vegetables (onions and green onions in our project)
in less then favorable enviroments like during the winter when growing basic greens is problematic.
We are planning to construct a cube shaped construct. The upper side of it will have LED's (for delivering enough light to the plant for sufficient growth),
an ultrasonic sensor for distance detection to the plant and a continuous motor for adjusting height from the plant.
The construct will also include humidity sensors in the enviroment(to detect air humidity) and a humidity sensor in the soil(to determine
if the plant has to be watered) and a light sensor to determine if the plant has sufficient amounts of light). We are going to use Raspberry pi as our mainboard and main computer.
And a computer fan to help with air circulation in the enviroment of the constructed box. Problems: 3D-modelling of the box, ~~My problems started around a week after I was born (c) Dainis~~
Designing electrical circuits of sensors (which pins should we use), proper formulas for light intensity detection by the light sensor, soledring and software problems. 

# Schedule for Pair A (Dainis and Kirill):


Week 1, 12.11 - 18.11: 
Dainis = Reading and getting to know the sensors to work with.
Kirill = Discussing with Daniel about how to properly set up our Raspberry pi with
needed sensors, paper plan for programming.

Week 2, 19.11 - 25.11: 
Dainis = Blueprint of the electric circuit.
Kirill = According to the plan, we have to set up and test each sensor separately and if time allows, also together.

Week 3, 26.11 - 02.12: 
Dainis = Electronic circuit construction.
Kirill = Making overall program for all of the sensors and raspberry pi control. Make sure that everything works.
Preparing programming part of our Demo video.

Week 4, 03.12 - 09.12: 
Dainis = Testing circuit with programms, debugging.
Kirill = Debugging and further stress testing. Preparing programming part of our Poster.

Week 5, 10.12 - 16.12:
Dainis = Setting up final demo.
Kirill = Setting up construct for final live demo (and preparing for poster, robustness, ingenuity and the end results).

# Schedule for Pair B (Daniel and Shawon):


Week 1, 12.11 - 18.11: 
Daniel = Discussing with Kirill about how to properly set up our Raspberry pi with
needed sensors, paper plan for programming.
Shawon = Blueprint of construct frame on paper.

Week 2, 19.11 - 25.11: 
Daniel = According to the plan, we have to set up and test each sensor separately and if time allows, also together.
Shawon = Browsing and choosing 3D-modelling program.

Week 3, 26.11 - 02.12: 
Daniel = Making overall program for all of the sensors and raspberry pi control. Make sure that everything works. Preparing
programming part of our Demo video.
Shawon = Creating the 3D construct.

Week 4, 03.12 - 09.12: 
Daniel = Debugging and further stress testing. Preparing programming part of our Poster.
Shawon = 3D-printing of the construct/Assembly and Debugging.

Week 5, 10.12 - 16.12: 
Daniel = Setting up construct for final live demo (and preparing for poster, robustness, ingenuity and the end results).
Shawon = Demo.

We will divide all the programming tasks between 2 of us (Kirill and Daniel), but in general,
we have to work together on same tasks according to the programming plan (like we did in Robotex). We will discuss it later on with instructors.
I hope we will not lose any points for filling up the same plan for programming. Thank you in advance!
