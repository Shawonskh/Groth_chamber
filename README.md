Overview
How often do you find your favourite flowers or healthy house-grown vegetables dry and dead because you are always forget to water them? How many times the idea of having your own small garden with healing herbs came to your mind? 
We suppose that our Growth Chamber for Plants can be used at any place and any conditions where plants supposed to grow. The reason for that is that this Smart Chamber will help you to automate and improve the process of growing the plants in couple of clicks!
The Smart Chamber will keep track of temperature and humidity around the plant, preserve the necessary humidity level and extend the light cycle which is crucial for fast and positive growth.
You need to choose the plant, prepare the water supply, setup couple of settings and enjoy the life while Chamber is doing its job
Schedule
A weekly plan for completing the project (list of tasks for each week). You need to divide the problem into subtasks that need to be solved in order to complete the whole project. The schedule should extend all the way to the final presentation and have the time you are planning to use on each step with it. Consider collective input rather than individual one. If a task takes 20h to complete according to your plan then this means that you as a team need to input that 20h not each individual.

Present it in table form. It has to have following columns: item, quantity, and whether you-need-this-component-from-us. This information is crucial for your projects success. The table should contain all of the components you need to complete the project. Have look at the available hardware list at the end of the project topic. We might be able to provide some hardware outside of this list but in other cases you need to provide your own hardware if you need something out of the ordinary.

I checked the repository the project has been discussed and we are planning to make next steps as soon as possible. By Sakhawat
